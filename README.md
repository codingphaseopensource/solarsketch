Web Application where solar panel arrays can be drawn.

Features Will Include:

Phase 1 Features:
Basic Array Measurement Calculator (Block Shaped)
  Maths:
    ((Panel Width * (# of Panels))+(# of Gaps) = Total Array Width
    ((Panel Height * (# of Panels))+(# of Gaps[Gap will not be the same as width gap]) = Total Array Height
    
Future Calculator Features:
  Store Panel Dimensions
  Array will be displayed (Recommend drawing as a grid)
  Will be able to handle misshappen array varieties (offsets & gaps in array)
  
----------------------------------------
String Mapping Tool (Way out there feature)
  String map calculator (how many strings will I need dependent upon inverter wattage supported)
  What is the wattage of panels is important for above feature.
  Pathing for optimized systems (panels are strung together to create a loop)
  How many panels are in each string
  Will show positive end of a string, negative end of a string
  Will show a block for where your Soladeck or Roof Penetration
  Determine your length of PV wire required to reach Soladeck
